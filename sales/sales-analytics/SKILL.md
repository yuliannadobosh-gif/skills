# Sales Analytics

Analyze sales performance using data from Coupler.io dataflows (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Close, Zoho, custom CRMs). This skill guides you through retrieving opportunity/deal data, computing pipeline and conversion metrics, investigating velocity and rep performance, detecting anomalies, and presenting actionable insights a sales leader can act on.

## Step 0: Context Check (Pre-requisite)

Before starting any analysis, the **Data Context Check** skill (`generate-data-set-context`) runs as a gate. It calls `get-schema` on each target dataset to determine whether meaningful context is attached — particularly stage definitions, segment mappings (SMB/MM/Enterprise), team/territory structure, lead source taxonomy, and how 'closed-lost no decision' is distinguished from 'closed-lost competitive'.

- If context exists → proceed to Step 1.
- If context is missing → the user is offered the option to generate it first.

Do not duplicate this check in Step 1d.

## Step 1: Discover and Select Data Sources

### 1a. Discover available data

Default to `search-datasets` with sales-flavored keywords — `salesforce`, `hubspot`, `pipedrive`, `close`, `zoho`, `opportunities`, `deals`, `pipeline`, `leads`, `activities`, or whatever CRM the user named. Search keeps the response small and lands on the right dataflow when the domain is known.

Fall back to `list-datasets` only when the user is genuinely browsing or hasn't given any source/keyword to anchor on. Each dataflow represents a CRM data pipeline (e.g. "Salesforce Opportunities", "HubSpot Deals", "Pipedrive Pipeline", "Salesforce Activities", "Lead Sources").

### 1b. Select relevant datasets

**Unambiguous match (1 dataflow)** → use it; mention which one.

**Obvious candidates (2–3)** → state your selection with one-line reasoning, proceed but invite corrections.

**Ambiguous (5+, or unclear)** → present best candidates (up to 5–7) grouped by source/scope, with reasoning, and wait for confirmation:

```
I found 4 dataflows likely relevant to your win-rate question:
  1. salesforce_opportunities — full pipeline with stage history
  2. hubspot_deals — older deals not migrated to SF
  3. salesforce_activities — calls/emails per opportunity
  4. closed_lost_reasons — categorized loss reasons
Should I focus on 1 alone, or include 4 to break down the loss reasons?
```

**Hard gate only when ambiguous.**

### 1c. Get dataflow details

Call `get-dataflow` for each candidate. Note `schedule`, source health, and last successful run — CRM extracts can lag, and pipeline snapshots become misleading fast.

### 1d. Understand the data structure

Call `get-schema` on each target dataset. If context was generated in Step 0, use the enriched schema directly.

For sales/CRM schemas, watch for: opportunity_id, account_id, owner_id, stage, stage_history (rare; often requires snapshots), amount/expected_amount, close_date, created_date, won/lost flags, lead_source, segment, territory, probability. Stage history is the load-bearing one for cycle/conversion analysis — if it's missing, flag that some metrics will be approximations.

### 1e. Sample the data

Sample each dataset. Watch for: deals stuck in legacy stages, missing close_date on open deals, amount in mixed currencies, deals tagged closed-won but with empty amount (services or trials), duplicate deal records across systems.

## Step 2: Compute Metrics via SQL

Always compute via SQL in `get-data`.

### Working with multiple datasets

**Date alignment:** created_date, last_modified, close_date, stage_change_date — confirm which the user wants. 'Pipeline as of date X' typically uses close_date filtered by stage status as of X (requires snapshot history).

**Currency normalization:** Multi-currency CRMs need conversion (most have a currency field per opportunity). State your conversion approach.

**Open vs. closed:** Be explicit which population you're analyzing. 'Pipeline' usually means open deals. 'Win rate' usually means closed (won + lost) deals — open deals don't count yet.

**Snapshot vs. live:** Live CRM data is point-in-time current. To compute 'pipeline as of last quarter', you need historical snapshots (often via daily extracts). Without snapshots, you can only approximate using created_date and close_date.

## Step 3: Draft Findings and Get User Feedback

Before generating a full analysis, present a brief summary — top 3–5 findings, anomalies, direction. Wait for user response.

## Step 4: Build the Analysis

### Pipeline Review

Snapshot the current open pipeline:

- **Total pipeline value** — sum of open deal amounts, weighted (× probability) and unweighted.
- **Stage distribution** — count and value by stage. Healthy pipeline shows progression; bunched-at-stage-1 signals a stalled top-of-funnel.
- **Pipeline coverage** = (open pipeline closing in period) / (target for period). Healthy: 3x for the current quarter.
- **Aging** — days in current stage. Deals stuck >2x average stage time are at risk.
- **Top 10 deals** — biggest open deals with stage, age, owner, expected close. Always show the leaderboard, even if the user didn't ask.

### Win Rate Investigation

- **Overall win rate** = closed-won / (closed-won + closed-lost) for the period.
- **By segment** — SMB/MM/Enterprise rates often differ 2–3x; report separately.
- **By source** — inbound vs. outbound vs. partner can differ wildly.
- **By rep** — flag outliers (best, worst), but caveat with sample size — a rep with 4 deals doesn't have a meaningful rate.
- **Loss reason analysis** — if loss reasons are tagged, group them: price, product fit, no-decision, competitive, timing. No-decision losses signal qualification issues; competitive losses signal product/positioning issues.

### Velocity & Cycle Analysis

- **Sales velocity** = (# open opportunities × avg deal size × win rate) / sales cycle length (days). Quarterly velocity in $/day is a leading indicator.
- **Sales cycle (median days)** — created_date to close_date for closed-won deals. Use median, not mean — a few mega-deals skew the mean.
- **Stage cycle** — median days per stage. Identifies the bottleneck stage.
- **Stage conversion** — share of deals that progress from stage N to stage N+1 (vs. dying in stage N). Requires stage history; without it, approximate using created→won transitions.

### Rep Performance

- **Quota attainment** — actual / quota for the period. Distribution across the team matters more than the average.
- **Activity metrics** — calls, emails, meetings per rep (if activity data is connected). Correlate to outcomes; high activity / low conversion signals quality issues.
- **Win rate, avg deal size, cycle length** per rep, with sample size caveat.
- **Pipeline-built per rep** — leading indicator for next period's bookings.

Never single out a rep negatively without enough data (n>10 closed deals minimum). Frame development opportunities, not failures.

### Anomaly Detection and Metric Investigations

Apply this framework whenever investigating a change, drop, or spike (e.g., 'why did our win rate drop'):

**Severity classification:**
- **Informational** — within 1 SD of trailing-quarter average, or <5pp change in rate metrics. Note it.
- **Warning** — 1–2 SD, or 5–10pp change. Investigate, present hypotheses.
- **Critical** — >2 SD, >10pp change, or pipeline coverage dropping below 2x. Lead with this finding.

**Baseline comparison:** Same quarter prior year (sales has annual cycles), trailing 4-quarter average, target/budget.

**Root cause investigation steps:**
1. **Isolate the scope** — one segment, one source, one team, one product line, or everything?
2. **Check data freshness** — are recent stage changes recorded? CRM hygiene gaps make 'metric drops' that are really data gaps.
3. **Check upstream changes** — territory realignment, comp plan changes, pricing updates, product launches/sunsets, marketing source mix shifts.
4. **Check for data issues** — bulk-edited deals, duplicates, deals reassigned mid-cycle, stage definitions changed.
5. **Present hypotheses ranked by likelihood** — "Most likely: enterprise segment win rate dropped 12pp, accounts for 80% of the overall drop. Less likely: rep churn — only 2 reps left this quarter."

## Step 5: Present Results

Lead with the headline. Plain language. Every finding gets a 'So what?' and 'Now what?'

**Abbreviation expansion:** First use of CRM, ACV, ARR, MQL, SQL (sales-qualified lead, NOT structured query language — disambiguate if both meanings could apply), CAC, NRR — expand.

**Sample size caveats:** When breaking down by rep/source/segment, state n. "Inbound has a 28% win rate (n=42) vs outbound's 14% (n=8)."

## Rules & Edge Cases

- Always state data freshness (when the dataflow last ran) and whether the period is in-progress or closed.
- Open vs. closed populations: never silently mix them. 'Pipeline win rate' is almost always nonsense — open deals don't have outcomes yet.
- Probability fields: confirm whether they're rep-set or stage-derived. Rep-set probabilities are often inflated.
- Stage definitions: stage names like 'Discovery' or 'Negotiation' mean different things at different companies — defer to the user's stage glossary if context exists.
- Multi-currency: state your normalization. Don't sum amounts across currencies without conversion.
- Snapshots: if doing historical analysis without snapshot data, say so. "This 'pipeline as of Q1' is approximated from created_date and stage; without daily snapshots, deals that moved stage mid-quarter are counted at their final stage, not their Q1-end stage."
- Channel/source double-counting: deals with both inbound and outbound activity may be tagged inconsistently. Pick one source-of-truth field per analysis and stick to it.
- Rep attribution: if territory or owner changed mid-deal, state how you're attributing the win/loss.
- Sample-size minimums: per-rep stats with n<10 closed deals are noise — use them to spot patterns, not for performance reviews.
- If a dataflow's last execution failed or is stale (>1 day for daily-refresh CRM data), warn the user.
