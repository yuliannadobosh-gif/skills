## What can you do with Coupler.io skills?

Use AI agent skills to:

- Analyze marketing performance across Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, and other channels
- Find wasted PPC spend and opportunities to scale campaigns
- Review sales pipelines, win rates, deal velocity, and rep performance
- Analyze P&L, MRR, ARR, cash runway, and financial performance
- Measure ecommerce conversion, AOV, retention, and repeat purchases
- Generate structured business reports with validated metrics
- Investigate anomalies and explain changes in business KPIs
- Create and configure Coupler.io dataflows through AI

## Quick start

Add the Coupler.io skills marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add coupler-io/skills
```

Then install the skill set you need:

```
/plugin install coupler-marketing-ads@coupler-io-skills
/plugin install coupler-finance@coupler-io-skills
/plugin install coupler-sales@coupler-io-skills
/plugin install coupler-ecommerce@coupler-io-skills
```

Install only what you need. Every skill's description stays in context for the whole session, so a plugin costs tokens in proportion to how many skills it carries. See [Installation](#installation) for the full plugin list, team setup, and manual install.

You also need a [Coupler.io](https://coupler.io) account with the MCP server connected, so the skills have live data to work against.

## Skills library

Skills are organized by business function - Finance, Sales, Ecommerce, and Marketing & Ads - with additional shared capabilities and utilities.

### Marketing & PPC

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**marketing-analytics**](marketing-and-ads/marketing-analytics/SKILL.md) | Marketing performance — campaign analysis, cross-channel comparison, anomaly detection. Covers paid, organic, email, and social. |
| [**ppc-analytics**](marketing-and-ads/ppc-analytics/SKILL.md) | Paid-ads (PPC) performance — per-platform funnel traces, efficiency-first comparison (ranked on CPA/ROAS), budget pacing, ad-fatigue checks, and honest attribution (never blends conversions across platforms; offers an independent-source cross-check and blended CAC). Facebook + Google Ads first-class. |

#### Google Ads deep dives

Eight Google-Ads-only skills in `marketing-and-ads/google-ads/`. Each one owns a single question and hands off to the others rather than duplicating them — `ppc-analytics` stays the cross-platform paid view. When a request needs a field no packaged report type carries, they route to `capability/google-ads-custom-gaql`.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**google-ads-performance-review**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-performance-review/SKILL.md) | The baseline read — what changed in the account and why. Period comparison, cost-per-lead moves, impression-share loss. Run this before deciding anything else. |
| [**google-ads-waste-and-scale**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-waste-and-scale/SKILL.md) | The cutting view — search-term waste, negative-keyword candidates, what to pause, and a budget-neutral reallocation proposal. |
| [**google-ads-keyword-and-quality-score-analysis**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-keyword-and-quality-score-analysis/SKILL.md) | The earning view — which keywords deserve more money, which overcharge for the same clicks, match-type and quality-score diagnosis. |
| [**google-ads-budget-pacing**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-budget-pacing/SKILL.md) | Month-end arithmetic — on-track or overspending, daily target, which campaigns are budget-capped, and whether more budget would do anything. |
| [**google-ads-conversion-tracking-audit**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-conversion-tracking-audit/SKILL.md) | Whether the conversion numbers can be trusted at all — double-counting, Analytics disagreement, untracked spend. Run before any cost or return conclusion. |
| [**google-ads-settings-audit**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-settings-audit/SKILL.md) | Account configuration priced in the spend flowing through it — search partners, Display expansion, location intent, auto-apply, ad rotation, conversion windows, bid strategies. |
| [**google-ads-pmax-transparency**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-pmax-transparency/SKILL.md) | Opening the Performance Max black box — Shopping cannibalisation, brand-traffic buying, asset-group performance. |
| [**google-ads-client-report**](marketing-and-ads/google-ads/google-ads-client-report/SKILL.md) | The monthly client write-up — what to say, how to present a missed target. Built only when asked. |

#### TikTok Ads deep dives

Eleven TikTok-only skills in `marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/`. Same shape as the Google pack — each owns a single question and routes to its siblings rather than duplicating them, with `ppc-analytics` still the cross-platform paid view.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**tiktok-ads-performance-review**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-performance-review/SKILL.md) | The baseline read — what moved, which campaigns moved it, and how much of the change each one caused. Run this before deciding anything else. |
| [**tiktok-ads-waste-and-scale**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-waste-and-scale/SKILL.md) | The cutting view — what to turn off and what to fund with the money, as one decision rather than two. |
| [**tiktok-ads-creative-analysis**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-creative-analysis/SKILL.md) | Which videos earn their spend, where the losing ones lose people, and what the next round should be. |
| [**tiktok-ads-creative-fatigue-and-velocity**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-creative-fatigue-and-velocity/SKILL.md) | Which videos are dying, how long they have left, and how many new ones a month the account needs to keep up. |
| [**tiktok-ads-audience-analysis**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-audience-analysis/SKILL.md) | Which audiences earn their spend — and whether targeting is doing any work the creative was not already doing. |
| [**tiktok-ads-budget-pacing**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-budget-pacing/SKILL.md) | Where the month ends if nothing changes, the daily spend to land on plan, and which ad groups will not take more money. |
| [**tiktok-ads-pixel-and-attribution-audit**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-pixel-and-attribution-audit/SKILL.md) | Whether the conversion numbers can be trusted before you move budget on them. Run before any cost or return conclusion. |
| [**tiktok-ads-structure-and-learning-review**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-structure-and-learning-review/SKILL.md) | Whether the account is split into more ad groups than its budget can feed, priced in what that costs in delivery. |
| [**tiktok-ads-placement-geo-and-device**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-placement-geo-and-device/SKILL.md) | Where and when the money actually goes, and what each of those places is worth. |
| [**tiktok-ads-gmv-max-and-shop-review**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-gmv-max-and-shop-review/SKILL.md) | What GMV Max is actually buying, whether it cannibalises campaigns already making those sales, and which products carry it. |
| [**tiktok-ads-client-report**](marketing-and-ads/tiktok-ads/tiktok-ads-client-report/SKILL.md) | The monthly client write-up — the kind that survives being questioned. Built only when asked. |

#### Meta / Facebook Ads deep dives

Eleven Meta-only skills in `marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/`. Same shape as the Google pack — each owns a single question and routes to its siblings rather than duplicating them, with `ppc-analytics` still the cross-platform paid view.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**facebook-ads-performance-review**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-performance-review/SKILL.md) | The baseline read — what moved this period and which campaigns moved it. Cost decomposed into CPM, CTR and conversion rate. Run this before deciding anything else. |
| [**facebook-ads-waste-and-scale**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-waste-and-scale/SKILL.md) | The cutting view — ad sets spending without results, creative past its fatigue threshold, each cut paired with where the money should go instead. |
| [**facebook-ads-creative-analysis**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-creative-analysis/SKILL.md) | Which ads win and why — thumbstop and hook rate, what the winners have in common, and the brief for the next production round. |
| [**facebook-ads-creative-fatigue**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-creative-fatigue/SKILL.md) | How long the winners have left — CTR decay against first-week baseline, CPM drift, a refresh queue ranked by spend at risk, and monthly creative volume needed. |
| [**facebook-ads-audience-analysis**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-audience-analysis/SKILL.md) | Which audiences earn their spend — lookalike vs interest vs broad vs retargeting, saturation as audiences age, and who is being paid for twice. |
| [**facebook-ads-budget-pacing**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-budget-pacing/SKILL.md) | Month-end arithmetic — on-track or overspending, required daily spend, which ad sets are capped, and whether more budget would do anything. |
| [**facebook-ads-pixel-and-attribution-audit**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-pixel-and-attribution-audit/SKILL.md) | Whether the conversion numbers can be trusted — pixel and CAPI coverage, deduplication, view-through share, the platform-vs-store gap. Run before any cost or return conclusion. |
| [**facebook-ads-settings-audit**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-settings-audit/SKILL.md) | Configuration priced in the spend flowing through it — optimisation goals, bid strategy, Advantage+ and expansion toggles, attribution setting. Most of these default in Meta's favour. |
| [**facebook-ads-structure-and-learning-review**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-structure-and-learning-review/SKILL.md) | How the account is organised and what that costs in learning — ad sets stuck below event volume, fragmentation, audience overlap, consolidation with the spend affected. |
| [**facebook-ads-placement-geo-and-device**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-placement-geo-and-device/SKILL.md) | Where the budget actually goes — Feed vs Reels vs Stories vs Audience Network, region, device and delivery hour, each with what it is worth. |
| [**facebook-ads-client-report**](marketing-and-ads/facebook-ads/facebook-ads-client-report/SKILL.md) | The monthly client write-up — KPIs against goal, creative winners, the attribution caveat stated once and plainly. Built only when asked. |

### Sales

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**sales-analytics**](sales/sales-analytics/SKILL.md) | Sales pipeline — win rates, velocity, cycle length, rep performance, stage conversion. Works with Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Close, Zoho, and more. |

### Finance

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**finance-analytics**](finance/finance-analytics/SKILL.md) | Financial performance — P&L review, MRR/ARR bridge, cash runway, cost-center investigation. Works with QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Stripe, Sage, and more. |

### Ecommerce

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**ecom-analytics**](ecommerce/ecom-analytics/SKILL.md) | E-commerce performance — funnel conversion, AOV, cohort retention, repeat purchase, anomaly detection. Works with Shopify, WooCommerce, GA4, Klaviyo, Stripe, and more. |

#### Shopify deep dives

Four Shopify-only skills in `ecommerce/shopify/`. Same shape as the ads packs — each owns a single question and routes to its siblings rather than duplicating them, with `ecom-analytics` still the cross-platform store view. They share their definitions deliberately: store performance is the baseline the others read against, and sell-through, inventory value and dead-stock cash live in one skill only.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**shopify-store-performance**](ecommerce/shopify/shopify-store-performance/SKILL.md) | The baseline read — the full sales ladder, orders, AOV, refunds vs returns, new vs returning, and which of the three drivers moved revenue. Run this before deciding anything else. |
| [**shopify-product-and-variant-sales**](ecommerce/shopify/shopify-product-and-variant-sales/SKILL.md) | Which products and variants earn their place — ranked by money and by margin on the right cost basis, with stock-out distortion flagged instead of buried. |
| [**shopify-inventory-and-stockout-risk**](ecommerce/shopify/shopify-inventory-and-stockout-risk/SKILL.md) | What runs out, when, what it costs, and the date you must order by — plus inventory value split four ways and the cash parked in dead stock. |
| [**shopify-repeat-purchase-and-retention**](ecommerce/shopify/shopify-repeat-purchase-and-retention/SKILL.md) | Which campaign and which first offer bought customers who came back — cohorts cut by UTM and discount status, with open cohorts excluded from every comparison. |

### Capabilities

Shared building blocks. Compose these with any domain skill above.

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**get-started**](capability/get-started/SKILL.md) | Onboard a brand-new or empty workspace from zero to the user's own data in the chat — anchor on stated intent, route template-or-scratch, script the guided credential round-trip, build + run the first dataflow, then offer a refresh schedule. |
| [**create-dataflow**](capability/create-dataflow/SKILL.md) | Configure a Coupler.io dataflow end to end — pick an integration, attach a credential, wire source → destination, and trigger a run. |
| [**google-ads-custom-gaql**](capability/google-ads-custom-gaql/SKILL.md) | Build a Custom GAQL source when no packaged Google Ads report type carries the field — and name the packaged type when one does. Covers resource choice, date macros, and the raw column names and micros that come back. |
| [**generate-data-set-context**](capability/generate-data-set-context/SKILL.md) | Produce an AI-readable description for a dataset so future sessions inherit its schema context. |
| [**refine-prompt**](capability/refine-prompt/SKILL.md) | Sharpen a vague or underspecified analytics request into a detailed, actionable prompt — filling in time period, metrics, data sources, and output format — before analysis. |
| [**report-generation**](capability/report-generation/SKILL.md) | Industry-agnostic report formatter and validator. Turns analysis output into a structured TL;DR → Metrics → Context → Recommendations → Next Questions report, then runs a Phase 2 validation pass (arithmetic, units, claim-vs-data, logical gates). Compose with a domain skill for domain-flavored reports. |

### Utilities

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**humanizer**](utilities/humanizer/SKILL.md) | Rewrites AI-generated text to remove detectable patterns and add human voice. Also available as the `/humanize` slash command. |
| [**coupler-live-artifact**](utilities/coupler-live-artifact/SKILL.md) | Builds a live Cowork artifact — a persistent, re-openable HTML widget backed by a Coupler.io dataflow that auto-refreshes (live dashboards, daily-check pages, data explorers). |

## How Coupler.io skills work

A skill is a reusable set of instructions that tells an AI agent how to perform a specific analytics task.

The skill uses Coupler.io MCP tools to discover datasets, inspect schemas, query live business data, and return a structured analysis.

Skills define **how to analyze** your data.
Coupler.io MCP provides **access to the data and tools** needed to perform the analysis.

## Installation

**From the marketplace** — add this repo as a plugin marketplace, then install the per-cluster plugin(s) you want:

```
/plugin marketplace add coupler-io/skills
/plugin install coupler-finance@coupler-io-skills
```

Each business function is its own plugin, so you install only what you need. Available plugins:

| Plugin | Skills it installs |
| --- | --- |
| `coupler-finance` | finance-analytics |
| `coupler-sales` | sales-analytics |
| `coupler-ecommerce` | ecom-analytics |
| `coupler-marketing-ads` | marketing-analytics, ppc-analytics, + the 8 Google Ads, 11 Meta / Facebook Ads and 11 TikTok Ads deep dives |
| `coupler-capability` | get-started, create-dataflow, google-ads-custom-gaql, generate-data-set-context, refine-prompt, report-generation |
| `coupler-utilities` | coupler-live-artifact |
| `humanizer` | humanizer (+ `/humanize` command) |

Plugin skills are namespaced by their plugin, so they can be invoked explicitly as `/coupler-finance:finance-analytics`. Most of them are model-invoked too — Claude reaches for them when the request matches their description. If the install summary says `Run /reload-plugins to activate.`, run that.

**Install only the plugin you need.** Every skill's description stays in context for the whole session, so a plugin's cost scales with how many skills it carries. `coupler-marketing-ads` bundles 32 and adds roughly 5.5k tokens to every session; the single-skill plugins add a few hundred. Check any plugin before installing it:

```
claude plugin details coupler-marketing-ads@coupler-io-skills
```

**For a whole team** — register the marketplace in the repository's `.claude/settings.json` so collaborators get it once they trust the folder:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "coupler-io-skills": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "coupler-io/skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This adds the marketplace, not the plugins. Each person still runs `/plugin install <plugin>@coupler-io-skills` to pick what they want. To pre-enable plugins as well, see [`enabledPlugins`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings-reference#plugin-settings).

**Manual** — copy any skill folder (each contains a `SKILL.md`) into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory. Skills installed this way are not namespaced, and Claude activates them when the request matches their description.

## Coupler.io MCP tools

These are the tools the Coupler.io MCP server exposes. Skills use them automatically — you only need to know them if you are writing a new skill or calling tools directly.

### Skills

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list-skills` | Names + one-line descriptions of every available skill. Always the first call. |
| `get-skill` | Full procedure for a named skill. |

### Discovery

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `list-templates` | Pre-built recipes filtered by source, metric, or category. Fastest path to skip manual setup. |
| `list-integrations` | Every integration the platform supports (400+). |
| `list-credentials` | What the user is already authorized for. |
| `list-datasets` | Every dataset across every dataflow. Use for full-picture browsing. |
| `search-datasets` | Narrows datasets by name, source, or free-text. Prefer over `list-datasets` when you have a keyword. |

### Inspection

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `get-integration` | Parameters and auth shape for one integration. Required before configuring anything. |
| `get-integration-field-options` | Resolves dynamic dropdown values (e.g. Salesforce objects, Google Ads accounts). Call when `get-integration` flags `resolve_options_with_tool: true`. |
| `get-dataflow` | Current state of one dataflow — sources, destinations, schedule, last run. |
| `get-schema` | Column types and AI context for one dataset. Required before querying. |
| `get-data` | SQL against the dataset's `data` table. Start with `SELECT * FROM data LIMIT 5` to confirm shape. |

### Configuration

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `create-dataflow` | Create a new empty dataflow. |
| `create-dataflow-from-template` | Create a fully configured dataflow from a template. Use when `list-templates` returns a match — skips manual assembly. |
| `create-dataflow-source` | Attach a source (Stripe, Postgres, …) to a dataflow. |
| `create-dataflow-destination` | Attach a destination (Sheets, BigQuery, Looker Studio, …) to a dataflow. |
| `update-dataflow-source` | Change source parameters; merges into existing config. |
| `update-dataflow-destination` | Change destination parameters. |

### Run & persist

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `run-dataflow` | Kick off a refresh from the source. |
| `update-dataset` | Save a markdown description on a dataset so future sessions inherit it. |

> **Deprecated:** `list-dataflows` — replaced by `list-datasets`.

---

## Skill frontmatter

The [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter) allows only six top-level frontmatter keys — `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` — and a `SKILL.md` carrying anything else can be rejected outright. Claude Code's own [frontmatter reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#frontmatter-reference) accepts considerably more (`when_to_use`, `model`, `effort`, `context`, `agent`, `argument-hint`, `disable-model-invocation`, `allowed-tools`, `disallowed-tools`, and others), but those are Claude-only extensions that other runtimes ignore. We target the portable six, so everything of ours lives under `metadata`:

```yaml
---
name: sales-analytics
description: Use this skill when the user wants to analyze sales pipeline, review win rates, … # for the agent: what it does and when to reach for it
metadata:
  short_description: Pipeline health, win rates, sales velocity and rep performance, straight from your CRM. # for humans: one line, shown in the UI
  category: sales
  sources:
    - Salesforce
---
```

`description` is the agent's routing signal, so it is long and stuffed with trigger phrases — unreadable in a skill catalog. `short_description` is the human-facing counterpart: one sentence, no "use this skill when", safe to render in a card or list. It is optional; consumers should fall back to a truncated `description` when it is absent.

`python .github/scripts/generate_skill_index.py --check` enforces the length limits:

| Field | Limit | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | 64 characters | [Spec](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter). Renaming means renaming the folder too — the two must match. |
| `description` | 1024 characters | [Spec](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter). |
| `metadata.short_description` | 200 characters | Ours. It renders in the UI, where anything longer than a sentence stops being scannable. |

Above 500 characters a `description` only earns a **warning** — it still passes. There is no consensus on the right length: [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) ships descriptions of 79–234 characters, while [coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills) runs 432–1014. The warning is a nudge to check the tail is still earning its context, not a rule — agents weigh the opening sentence most heavily.

Both descriptions land in `skills-index.json`, which is what the API and the MCP server read.

## Contributing and development

The machine-readable catalog is `skills-index.json`. **Do not edit it by hand** — it is generated from `SKILL.md` frontmatter. Change the skill files, then run `python .github/scripts/generate_skill_index.py`, or let the GitHub Action regenerate it on merge to `main`.
